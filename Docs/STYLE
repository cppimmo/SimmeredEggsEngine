This file explains the code styling/format of the C code.

Paranthesis use Java styling.
Avoid using underscores in variable names and types.
Enum and Struct types are followed by a trailing _t.
Name function pointers with prefix, PascalCase, and trailing Ptr.
Right align pointer symbols.
Use wrappers for malloc and free.
Liberally insert a new line after every 80 characters.
Use void parameter in all argumentless function definitions/declarations.
Do not use spaces between argument/parameter lists except after commas.
Use PascalCase for all functions.
Make all preprocessor defines in UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE.

Do not use prefixes for static functions.
Function Prefixes:
D_ for debug
G_ for application related
HU_ for heads up display
I_ for input
P_ for gameplay
R_ for renderer
S_ for sound
U_ for utility
